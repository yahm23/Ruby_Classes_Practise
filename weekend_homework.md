## The OO CodeClan Caraoke (CCC)

:star: This is a PDA Homework :star:

You have been approached to build software for a Karaoke bar. Specifically, they want you to build a software for checking guests in and out, plus handling songs.

Your program should be test driven and should be able to:

- Create rooms, songs and guests
- Check in guests to rooms/Check out guests from rooms
- Add songs to rooms

### Extensions

- What happens if there are more guests trying to be checked in than there is free space in the room?
- Karaoke venues usually have an entry fee - So the guests could have money so they can pay it.


### Advanced extensions

- Guests could have a favourite song, and if their favourite song is on the room's playlist, they can cheer loudly! (return a string like "Whoo!")
- Rooms can keep track of the entry fees/spending of the guests - maybe add a bar tab/bar class?
- Add anything extra you think would be good to have at a karaoke venue!


### PDA Reminder:

As part of this homework you are required to take screenshots of the following:

```
- An array in a program
- A function that uses the array
- The result of the function running
```

- Go to your [PDA Checklist](https://github.com/codeclan/pda/tree/master/Evidence%20Gathering%20Portfolio)

- Submit your PDA evidence (screenshots, etc.) to your own PDA repo

- PDA Reference: I.T 5
